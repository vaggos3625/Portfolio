**Deep Learning Project**

The goal of this project is to build an Artificial Neural Network that recognizes objects that you hold into the webcam. I chose a dataset of images containing bikes and cars. I creared, trained and tested a CNN model in order to achieve a precise regocnition of both vehicles.

*Technologies* : Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow
