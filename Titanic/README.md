**Classification Project**

In this project the dataset describes some fetures from the passengers of the Titanic. The goal is the prediction of each passenger's class ticket. As the classes of tickets are 3, this demands a multilabel classification model. I built, trained, evaluated and tested a Logistic Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor model

*Technologies* : Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn
