**Time Series Analysis and FOrecast for Madrid**
In this project the goal is to buid a time series model in order ot predict the temperature of Madrid. The dataset derives from www.ecad.eu and the temperatures are being recorded from 1920 till April 2022. Firstly, I cleaned the temperature, then I built a model to check the trend and the seasonality of the dataset, I plotted and inspected different components of a time series, I modeled time dependence of the remainder using an AR model, I compared the statistical output of different AR models and I tested the remainder for stationarity. 

*Technologies* : Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn
