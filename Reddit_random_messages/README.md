**Reddit Random Messages**
In this project, I built a data pipeline that collects reddits and stores them in a database. Next, the sentiment of reddits is analyzed and the annotated text is stored in a second database. Finally, the best or worst sentiment for a given is published on Slack periodically.

*Technologies* : Python, SQL, Docker, MongoDB
